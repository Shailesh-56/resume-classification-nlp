Project Title: Resume Classification using NLP & Machine Learning

📜 **Overview**
This project focuses on automatically classifying resumes into different job categories using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML). It helps streamline resume screening by leveraging TF-IDF vectorization and classification algorithms such as SVM, Random Forest, and Naïve Bayes.

🎯 **Objectives**
Process and analyze 100+ resumes
Extract key features using TF-IDF Vectorization
Train and evaluate multiple ML models (SVM, Random Forest, etc.)
Deploy a user-friendly Streamlit web app for resume classification

🛠️ **Technologies Used**
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks: NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning Models: SVM, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, KNNClassifier, Decision Tree
Feature Engineering: TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, Stopword Removal
Deployment: Streamlit

📊 **Dataset Details**
Collected 100+ resumes labeled into 4 job categories:
Workday
React JS Developer
SQL Developer
PeopleSoft

Preprocessed text:
Removed stopwords, punctuation, and special characters
Converted text to lowercase
Applied TF-IDF vectorization
